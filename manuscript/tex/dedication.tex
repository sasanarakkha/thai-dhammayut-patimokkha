Additional information on translations, as well as deviations\pagenote{%
  Due to the balanced and inspiring selction of chants, as well as for the sake of
  compatability, the WPN chanting book has served as the basis for the SBS
  chanting book. Over time, suggestions for the inclusion of additional chants, as
  well as occasional improvements of existing translations were incorporated. Such
  changes were meticulously marked down in the endnotes, so that someone familiar
  with the SBS chanting book can straight away find the relevant differences,
  which can be useful when visiting a branch monastery of the Ajahn Chah lineage,
  in order to know in which places to revert to the original version.}
from WPN Chanting Book (2014), have been annotated by Ven. Ariyadhammika in the endnotes.

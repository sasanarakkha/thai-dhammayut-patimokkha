  <p class="intro">Venerables, these four cases that are to be acknowledged come up for recitation.</p>

  <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_74"><a href="patidesaniya.xhtml#pd1">Acknowledgment 1: The first training precept on what is to be acknowledged</a><a id="ack1"></a></h2>

  <p>If any bhikkhu, having accepted [it] with his own hand from the hand of an unrelated bhikkhunī who has entered an inhabited area [for alms], should chew uncooked food or eat cooked food], [it] is to be acknowledged by that bhikkhu [saying]: “Friend[s], I have committed a blameworthy act which is unsuitable, which is to be acknowledged; I acknowledge it.”</p>

  <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_75"><a href="patidesaniya.xhtml#pd2">Acknowledgment 2: The second training precept on what is to be acknowledged</a><a id="ack2"></a></h2>

  <p>Now, bhikkhus who have been invited are eating among families, and if a bhikkhunī who is giving directions is standing there [saying], “Give curry here, give rice here!” [then] by those bhikkhus that bhikkhunī is to be dismissed [saying], “Go away, sister, for as long as the bhikkhus eat!,” and if not even one bhikkhu would speak against [it, so as] to dismiss that bhikkhunī [saying], “Go away, sister, for as long as the bhikkhus eat!,” [then it] is to be acknowledged by those bhikkhus, “Friend[s], we have committed a blameworthy act which is unsuitable, which is to be acknowledged; we acknowledge it.”</p>

  <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_76"><a href="patidesaniya.xhtml#pd3">Acknowledgment 3: The third training precept on what is to be acknowledged</a><a id="ack3"></a></h2>

  <p>Now, [there are] those families which are agreed upon as trainees: if any bhikkhu who has not been invited beforehand, who is not ill, should chew uncooked food or eat cooked food having accepted [it] with his own hand in families who are of such a kind, who are considered trainees, [then it] is to be acknowledged by that bhikkhu: “Friend[s], I have committed a blameworthy act which is unsuitable, which is to be acknowledged; I acknowledge it.”</p>

  <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_77"><a href="patidesaniya.xhtml#pd4">Acknowledgment 4: The fourth training precept on what is to be acknowledged</a><a id="ack4"></a></h2>

  <p>Now, [there are] those those wilderness lodgings which are considered risky, which are dangerous: if any bhikkhu, [staying] in lodgings which are of such a kind, without having announced [the danger] beforehand, having accepted [the food] with his own hand inside the monastery, [and then] not being ill, should chew uncooked food or eat cooked food, [then it] is to be acknowledged by that bhikkhu, “Friend[s], I have committed a blameworthy act which is unsuitable, which is to be acknowledged; I acknowledge it.”</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;">Venerables, the four cases that are to be acknowledged have been recited.<br/> Concerning that I ask the Venerables: [Are you] pure in this?<br/> A second time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this?<br/> A third time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this?<br/> The venerables are pure in this, therefore there is silence, thus I bear this [in mind].</p>

  <p class="outro">The [cases] which are to be acknowledged have finished</p>
